# Decrypting_Substitution_Cypher_with_genetic_algorithm

Implemented the work done by Jason Brownbridge, Department of Computer Science, University of Cape Town in his paper https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~jkenwood/JasonBrownbridge.pdf

created a model that selects a substitution key randomly  as a solution and then uses a probability function to check its effectiveness and later evolves the key using a defined genetic function
